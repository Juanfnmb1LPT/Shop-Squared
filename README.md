# CSV Shopify & Square Converter (Vue)
Live at https://juanfnmb1lpt.github.io/CSV-Converter/

Browser-based CSV tools for ecommerce workflows, now implemented as a Vue 3 single-page app with Vite.

All parsing and processing runs locally in the browser. No file data is uploaded to a server.

## Features

- Shopify → Square conversion (`square_import.csv` output)
- Update Shopify variant quantities from a Square inventory file
- Upload input supports CSV, XLSX, and XLS files
- Excel uploads use the first sheet and first row as headers, then flatten to row-based data
- Client-side parsing via PapaParse (CSV) and SheetJS (Excel)

## Run locally

Requirements:

- Node.js 18+

Commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The production build is generated in `dist/`.

## GitHub Pages deployment

This Vue app works on GitHub Pages.

This repo also includes an automated Pages workflow at [.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml](.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml) that builds and deploys from `main`.

In GitHub repo settings, set **Pages → Source** to **GitHub Actions** so the live site always matches the latest `main` build.

After enabling it, push to `main` (or run the workflow manually from the Actions tab) to publish the latest build.

Routing uses hash mode (`/#/`) so direct page refresh works on GitHub Pages without server rewrites.

## App routes

- `/` Home page with step page options
- `/#/pre-con` Pre-Con step page
- `/#/post-con` Post-Con step page
- `/#/shopify-to-square` Shopify → Square tool
- `/#/update-quantity` Update Shopify quantity tool

The app uses a persistent left dashboard for navigation between all pages.
